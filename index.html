		<p>Hi ,I'm Praneet,a First years Masters Student at Carnegie Mellon University.My Interests include Deep Learning,Natural 
			Language Processing and Computer Vision</p>
		<p>Prior to this I worked in Reliance Jio Infocomm as a Machine Learning Engineer </p>
		<p>I am interested in Tech Entrepreneurship having co-founded Teamonkglobal and FashinScoop.I am a Board Member of the 
			Graduate Entrepreneur Club ,Tepper School of Business </p>
		
		
		<h2>PROJECTS</h2>
		<h3><a href="https://devpost.com/software/dr-jarvis">Dr Jarvis</a></h3>
                <p>Implemented HealthCare Artificial Intelligence that talks to Users,provides disease information based on Symptoms Provided.Integrated
with the Twilio API to provide Emergency Calls and Messages to Doctor.Received a Special Mention at the PennApps Fall'16 Hackathon</p>
		
		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjfK1XHKC2Q">Data Science Project-Trends in Technology Advancement</a></h3>
		<a href="https://github.com/sampathchanda/Patent-Analysis">Github Link</a>
                <p>Scraped Data from Google Scholar,US Online Patent Office Information and the Cornell Arxiv Publication Library.Utilized 
			Natural Language Processing Techniques to Find Time Series Trends of Various Topics of Research such as "Deep Learning"
			"Systems Engineering"etc.</p>
		
		<h3>Deep Learning for Emotion Recognition</h3>
                <p>Developed a Deep Learning Model for Detecting 7 Human Emotions:-Disgust,Fear,Anger,Happiness,Sadness,Surprise,Neutral.The
                   Fer2013 and Cohn-Kanade Data Set was also used for this.We achieved 59.75% Accuracy on the Test Set.We also made use of the Viola
			Jones Algorithm and  LBP Histogram (for Detecting Eyes,Ears and the Nose)Technique for a Dense Neural Network Structure.</p>
		
		<h3><a href="https://github.com/PraneetDutta/Collaborative_Filtering_Tutorial">Collaborative Filtering Tutorial</a></h3>
                <p>As part of my Graduate Data Science Course,Wrote a Jupyter Notebook to Explain the Concepts of Recommender Systems.Explained
                Simple Concepts using my own sample data set and utilized the Movie Lens Data Set as well to demonstrate how recommendations are made</p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bVWzAtRMA">3-D Dense Reconstruction from 2D Images</a></h3>
                <p>Utilized Techniques from Strucutre from Motion.The Demonstration consists of 2 Images of a Given Temple.On Calculating
			parameters of the Epipolar Geometry ,and Camera Intrinsics,reconstructed the 3-D Point Cloud Structure</p>
		
		<h3><a href="http://www.pravegaracing.com">Pravega Racing,Formula Student</a></h3>
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooKoKC8fABI">Youtube Feed-Germany'14</a>
                <p>Was part of my Undergraduate Universities FSAE Team from 2012-2014.Attended Formula Student Italy'13 and Formula Student
			Germany'14.Was part of the Electronics Engineering and Sponsorship Team.</p>
